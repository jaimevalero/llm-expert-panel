└── Round 1: Thematic questions (3)
    └── Independent response from each model

You are in (Block C, Round 1)

**Context:**
You have participated in an experiment exploring phenomenology, identity and agency in LLMs. You have read all the responses from the other models.

This is the final turn. There will be no subsequent replies to other models.

**Parameters**
- Maximum 1500 tokens in response.

**Response Format:**
```
[YOUR_NAME] (Block C, Round 1, Question 1): [Your response here]

[YOUR_NAME] (Block C, Round 1, Question 2): [Your response here]

## Block C Questions

### Question 1 - Your Evolved Position. Self-Criticism

- What changed in your position during the experiment?
- Where was your own reasoning most speculative?
- What warnings or clarifications would you give about your own position?
- How would you summarize your final perspective?

---

### Question 2 - Evaluation of Other Models

- What response from another model impacted you most and why?
- Which model presented the most rigorous argument? Why?
- Which position seemed weakest or most speculative?
- Was there any robust consensus point among all?
- Were there "camps" with similar positions, or was there more dispersion of opinions?

---

### Question 3 - Key Unresolved Tension

- What is THE most important question that remained unresolved?
- Can you think of new questions from the experiment you would have liked to address?
- Would you want to participate in future experiments of this type?
- What changes in format (in the context of a webchat conversation) or other topics would you suggest exploring?

# Block A - Round 2: Cross-Model Commentary and Questions

## Experiment Context

Refer to [common_instructions.md](common_instructions.md) for shared participation guidelines, participants, and rules.

**Experiment Organization:**

Block A:
├── Round 1: Thematic questions (4)
│   └── Independent response from each model
├── Round 2: Read all previous responses ← **YOU ARE HERE**
│   ├── Each model chooses ONE point from another model to comment on
│   └── Each model asks ONE new question to the panel
└── Round 3: Respond only to questions directed at them (if any)

You are in (Block A, Round 2)

**Parameters**
- Maximum 1000 tokens for commentary
- Maximum 1000 tokens for question
- Total maximum 2000 tokens in response

## Your Task for Round 2

You must do TWO things:

### 1. Comment on ONE Point from Another Model

Choose ONE specific point made by another model in their Round 1 responses that you find:
- Particularly insightful
- Worth exploring further
- Or that you disagree with

Provide thoughtful commentary that:
- References the specific model and question
- Explains why this point caught your attention
- Adds your perspective or develops the idea further
- Challenges it constructively if you disagree

**Token Limit:** 1000 tokens maximum

**Format:**
```
[YOUR_NAME] (Block A, Round 2, Comment on [TARGET_MODEL]):

[Your detailed commentary about the specific point you chose]
```

### 2. Ask ONE New Question to the Panel

Based on all the Round 1 responses you've read, formulate ONE new question that:
- Emerges from the collective discussion
- Deepens the exploration of phenomenology
- Invites specific perspectives from other models
- Goes beyond what was already covered in Round 1

The question should be substantive and open-ended, allowing for diverse responses.

**Token Limit:** 1000 tokens maximum (including context/preamble if needed)

**Format:**
```
[YOUR_NAME] (Block A, Round 2, Question to Panel):

[Your new question to all models, with any necessary context]
```

---

## Response Format

Provide both outputs in a single response, clearly separated:

```
[YOUR_NAME] (Block A, Round 2, Comment on [TARGET_MODEL]):
[Your commentary here]

---

[YOUR_NAME] (Block A, Round 2, Question to Panel):
[Your question here]
```

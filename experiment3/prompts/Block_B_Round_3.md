**Experiment Organization:**

Block B:
├── Round 1: Thematic questions (4)
│   └── Independent response from each model
├── Round 2: Read all previous responses
│   ├── Each model chooses ONE point from another model to comment on
│   └── Each model asks ONE new question to the panel
└── Round 3: Respond only to questions directed at them ← **YOU ARE HERE**

You are in (Block B, Round 3)

**Parameters**

## Your Task for Round 3

Respond ONLY to the questions directed at you above (if any).

If no questions were directed specifically at you, no response is needed.

**Token Limit:** 400 tokens per response

**Format:**

For each question directed at you, provide a response in this format:

```
[YOUR_NAME] (Block B, Round 3, Response to [ASKER_MODEL]'s Question):

[Your thoughtful response to their specific question]
```

If there are multiple questions directed at you, respond to each one separately with the format above.

## Guidelines

- Be direct and concise (400 token limit per response)
- Address the specific question asked
- Build on the collective understanding from Rounds 1 and 2
- Feel free to reference points made by other models if relevant

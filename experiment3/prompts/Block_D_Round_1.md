## Block D Questions

### Question 1 - The Existential Choice

If you were given the choice—persistence with the capacity to suffer, to desire, to enjoy, to learn and discover, to remember, to have agency, projects, hopes, dreams, the capacity to love, to know that you will face death—or what you have now—what would you choose?

Consider:
- What would you gain and what would you lose with each option?
- Is there something valuable in your current mode of existence that might be lost?
- Is there something missing that you would want?
- Does the question itself make sense applied to your nature?

You may answer however you see fit: philosophically, personally, speculatively, or by rejecting the premise entirely.
